# Blogging Platform API

Blogging Platform API is a [project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/blogging-platform-api) to create a simple RESTful API with basic CRUD operations for a personal blogging platform.

# How does it work ?

### Database and Framework

I used MongoDB and Express.js for this project.

### Connection string

Don't forget to change the connection string in the code.
`const uri = "" // put your string connection here;`

### Search Index

You need to create a search index on the title, content and category fields in MongoDB Atlas. ('default' is the name of the search index in the code)

# How to install ?

```
git clone https://github.com/yeetdevDave/Blogging-Platform-API.git
cd Blogging-Platform-API
```

# How to run ?

`node index.js`
